                <h1 class="Article-Title"> Hey, my name is Nabil, and welcome to my story about how I fell in love with programming. </h1>

                <p class=" BlogText About-learning ">
                    When I first learned that a friend had developed the new fitness app for our group, i was really intrigued. It wasn't just admiration; it was an inspiration, a call to action.
                    I found myself wanted to do the same thing to start a similar journey, to delve into the world of coding and creation. I directly, turned to Google, typing in: "how to program."
                    Instantly, a flood of suggestions came to my screen, overwhelming yet enticing.
                </p>

                    <p class=" BlogText About-learning">
                        Despite my limited understanding, I was drawn to the strange lines of code,
                        reminiscent of the cascading green symbols from the iconic Matrix movies. Undeterred by my lack of expertise,
                        I delved into online tutorials, stumbling upon a YouTube video that promised to teach me all the ins and outs of programming.
                        Following its instructions, I hastily downloaded an IDE and attempted to replicate the steps laid out before me. Yet, despite my efforts,
                        success wasn't on my side.
                    </p>

                    <p class=" BlogText About-learning BlogText-End">
                        Determined to follow this newfound passion, I persisted in my goal for knowledge. This time, I specified my search, focusing on the creation of websites, unaware of the difference between frontend and backend development. It was then that I stumbled upon Scrimba, a beacon of light in my journey towards digital knowledge.
                        Enrolling in the HTML and CSS modules, I was transported into a world of creativity and design. With each lesson, I felt my skills growing, like a canvas coming to life under the masterful strokes of a painter's brush. It was a revelation, a realization of my innate connection to the art of digital creation.
                        Growing up in a household brimming with creativity, with parents who are both designers, I had always felt the pull of artistic expression. Yet, I lacked the technical skills to bring my visions to life. Now, armed with the tools of coding and design, I am determined to transform my ideas into beautiful digital creations.
                        And so, my journey continues, fueled by passion and guided by curiosity. With each line of code I write, I inch closer to realizing my dreams, creating a contribution towards the amazing world of digital masterpieces where there is are no bounds and creativity knows no limits.

                <h2 class=" Intro-Title"> "How I Maintain Commitment in Learning" </h2>
                <p class="BlogText About-learning ">
                    "I find it difficult to describe exactly what keeps me motivated to keep learning because I don't really need to be motivated. I just really love programming.
                    It's kind of like when a friend invites you to do something fun; you don't really have to make an effort, it's just something you're naturally drawn to.
                    Motivation is a feeling, and feelings are not consistent. So, I don't rely on the idea that my choices are dependent on my motivation. Instead,
                    it should become a habit or just a part of you."

                    "Coding is akin to gaming—a realm where imagination knows no bounds. It's serene until you confront a tough bug,
                    much like facing a relentless boss (Godskin Noble in the divine tower, lol). Despite the challenges, the satisfaction of overcoming them is incomparable.
                    It's a testament to resilience and the art of problem-solving, making every triumph incredibly fulfilling."

                <p class="BlogText BlogStory ">
                    I admire development for its boundless creativity. From idea to digital solution, programming offers endless possibilities,
                    making life easier. For example, creating apps to solve common issues like finding parking spots,
                    not only helps others out but can also be an amazing venture.
