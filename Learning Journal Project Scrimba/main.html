                    My journey into programming began when I discovered that a friend had secretly crafted our fitness app.
                    Inspired by their ingenuity, I embarked on my coding odyssey,
                    fueled by the desire to create transformative tools. <a  href="About-my-journey.html" class="My-journey-link">click here to learn more about my learning journey</a>

                            "When I first dove into frontend development, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information.
                            I stumbled upon a random Python tutorial on YouTube, but soon realized it wasn't what I needed. Turning to Replit's '100 Days of Code,'
                            At the time it was not what i was looking for. However, my determination led me to Scrimba, where I discovered comprehensive web design tutorials, unlocking
                            endless possibilities.
