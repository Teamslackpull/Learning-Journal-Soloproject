            <p class=" BlogText About-learning ">
                I'm Nabil, and this is my about me page. I enjoy playing the piano, gaming, and going to the gym, with the Deadlift being my favorite exercise.
                As for music, I'm a fan of composers like <a class="Music-Link" href="https://youtu.be/WA9wBIYSIJM?si=tAEdpd4WnMBCzQ-Z">Yann Tiersen</a> <a class="Music-Link" href="https://youtu.be/kfSnDd5mTsQ?si=8mR1jky26RlcCYXZ">Beethoven</a>,
                <a class="Music-Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koA4gVNCwXI&ab_channel=TonyAnn">Tony Ann</a>, and <a class="Music-Link" href="https://youtu.be/doc00tCkhOo?si=OYxbMCKxgmq6VcCc">Pianza</a>.
                Anime is another passion of mine, with favorites including Black Clover, The Eminence in the Shadow, Demon Slayer, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,
                and Attack on Titan, among others. And of course, programming is also something I really enjoy.

            <h2 class=" Intro-Title"> "My Journey into Programming"</h2>

            <p class=" BlogText About-learning BlogText-End">
                As you know, I was inspired by a friend to pursue development. After searching online,
                I explored various avenues for learning to code, but none felt right until I discovered Scrimba. Starting with HTML and CSS, I progressed slowly,
                mastering basics like styling and text formatting. Now halfway through the frontend development course, I'm about to complete the responsive design module. Next up: learning APIs, which I'm incredibly excited about.
                It's been a journey, and I'm thoroughly enjoying every step of learning to code.

            <h2 class=" Intro-Title"> My Learning Goals </h2>
            <p class="BlogText About-learning ">
                There are so many things I want to learn. One of the things I really want to learn is iOS development and  AI integration to give the websites I'm going to make an even better experience .
                About iOS apps, I really love Apple products. They are really solid and fast, and apps are so well-built and look really nice. I really want to be able to do that too. I have already found a course for that for in the future.
                And there are a lot of other interesting things I want to know, but for now, I will be focused on frontend and the course.

                    "Coding is akin to gaming—a realm where imagination knows no bounds. It's serene until you confront a tough bug,
                    much like facing a relentless boss (Godskin Noble in the divine tower, lol). Despite the challenges, the satisfaction of overcoming them is incomparable.
                    It's a testament to resilience and the art of problem-solving, making every triumph incredibly fulfilling."

                <p class="BlogText BlogStory ">
                    I admire development for its boundless creativity. From idea to digital solution, programming offers endless possibilities,
                    making life easier. For example, creating apps to solve common issues like finding parking spots,
                    not only helps others out but can also be an amazing venture.
